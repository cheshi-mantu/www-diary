# Español

¡Hola todos! Aquí, nos estudiamos la lengua española.

I beleive the study of a foreign language can be done the same way as you've already done it in your childhood – you get the templates, patterns, shortcuts, then you can start talking with neighbours, children, waiters, then you can start reading and get even more templates and patterns, which are correct ones, then you can study grammar in parallel with all the stuff you've started.

Don't be afraid to fail, don't be afraid to err.

¡Vamos!
