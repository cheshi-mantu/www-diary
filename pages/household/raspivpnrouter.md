# Using Raspberry Pi as VPN router

## Motivation

We need TV to work not in the local country but be visible as if it's working from another country to overcome certain restrictions.

## What we need

1. Raspberry Pi or Orange Pi or basically any micro-computer with Linux installed.
    * I used Raspberry Pi ver 4 with Gbytes of RAM and Raspbian 64 bits without GUI.
2. Ethernet USB Dongle.
   * Raspberry has only one Ethernet port, so we need to use external Ethernet adaptor. Pi has 4 USB ports so we are safe here.
3. Router with Ethernet ports.
   * You need to understand what is the IP address you router provides to the connected devices for easier identification of the Ethernet network adaptors in the next steps.
   * Login to your router, find DHCP setting and find something like Start IP address in the DHCP settings.
     * in my case that was 192.168.0.10, this means Raspberry Pi will get something like **192.168.0.XXX**, where XXX is something more or equal to 10.
4. 2 Ethernet cables
   * 1 for TV <> Raspberry Pi
   * 2 for Raspberry Pi <> Router
   * yes, yes we can use Wi-Fi for that, but we won't. Still it'll work the same way.
5. VPN provider (you can be one, or you can buy some that supports TUN).
   1. I'll use OpenVPN client with ProtonVPN VPN profiles.

## Target solution diagram

Raspberry Pi is going to wrap our TV's traffic into VPN connection and forbid the direct internet traffic from/to TV.

## Let's get crackin'

### Get all the stuff together

1. Install the OS to Raspberry Pi (use [their tool](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) for installing the OS).
2. Connect all the wires as per the image above.
3. Login to Raspberry Pi and start the configuration.

### Gather the names of the Ethernet network cards

The names provided in the picture above can be different from those you have in reality.

There is standard command in Linux OS `ifconfig` that provides the information on the network devices installed in your device. Or mode modern they say `ip`

Let's use ifconfig.

```shell
ifconfig | grep -B 1 -A 1 '192.168.0'
```

Where `| grep -B 1 -A 1 '192.168.0'` allows us filtering the output based on `192.168.0` and outputs 1 line before the match and 1 line after the match.

the output will be something like

```shell
enx000ec6aceaf9: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.0.21  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.0.255
        inet6 fe80::20e:c6ff:feac:eaf9  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
```

This means Raspberry Pi got the IP address 192.168.0.21 from my router, and the device that is used to connect Raspberry Pi to the router is **enx000ec6aceaf9**.

Now, if we execute same command again but without the grep part, we'll understand the whole piceture better.

```shell
ifconfig
end0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.99.1  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.99.255
        inet6 fe80::dea6:32ff:fe90:dff3  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether dc:a6:32:90:df:f3  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 36583  bytes 3012811 (2.8 MiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 541  bytes 30596 (29.8 KiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

enx000ec6aceaf9: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.0.21  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.0.255
        inet6 fe80::20e:c6ff:feac:eaf9  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 00:0e:c6:ac:ea:f9  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 658907  bytes 521544026 (497.3 MiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 369340  bytes 624843599 (595.8 MiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

lo: flags=73<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING>  mtu 65536
        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0
        inet6 ::1  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x10<host>
        loop  txqueuelen 1000  (Local Loopback)
        RX packets 41295  bytes 6760015 (6.4 MiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 41295  bytes 6760015 (6.4 MiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

For **lo** interface we have no interest, this is standard loopback. And there is **end0** interface which is up as well and has an IP address, this one seems to be the TV box we connected. There will be another interface wich is missinng now, something loke **tunXXX**, it will be created by the VPN application.

For sake of this very example, we'll use

- **enx000ec6aceaf9** as the network adaptor that is connected to our router

- **end0** as the network adaptor that is connected to our TV

### Get VPN up and running

I'm considering there is a VPN service in place and you've got configs for OpenVPN. We'll use **nl.protonvpn.net.udp.ovpn** for sake of this example.

#### Install OpenVPN

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install openvpn -y
```

Create a folder anywhere it won't be occasionally deleted. Jump to the folder and create files in this folder (and consider making backup copy from time to time ).

```shell
mkdir ~/sec
cd ~/sec
```

Copy **nl.protonvpn.net.udp.ovpn** to the said folder.

#### Starting VPN connection

```shell
sudo openvpn --config ./nl.protonvpn.net.udp.ovpn --daemon
```

As soon as OpenVPN will start and open VPN connection, **tun0** interface will appear in the output of **ifconfig** command.

```shell
tun0: flags=4305<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,NOARP,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 10.96.0.15  netmask 255.255.0.0  destination 10.96.0.15
        inet6 fe80::f911:3c80:8471:dc80  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ...
```

This is the interface we want our TV box to use for the internet access.

Also we can check if openvpn is running

```she
ps aux | grep openvpn
```

### Route all traffic of TV via VPN

Now, we need to forbid the TV box from using any connections except **tun0** to connect to the internet.

We'll use iptables to define the allowed routes. And we'll also need to keep our changes persistent, so we need to install

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install iptables
sudo apt install iptables-persistent
```

**iptables** generally allows managing and viewing rules for ip traffic, **iptables-persistent** allows making the changes you've made persistent across reboots.

Check what are current rules

```shell
sudo iptables -L -v -n --line-numbers
```

We don't need any residing rules, so let's flush it all

```she
sudo iptables -F && sudo iptables -t nat -F && sudo iptables -t mangle -F
sudo iptables -X && sudo iptables -t nat -X && sudo iptables -t mangle -X
```

to avoid blocking the traffic we can create defaul policy

```shell
sudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT && sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT && sudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
```

#### Routing TV traffic via VPN tun0

Now, we're starting to manipulate the IP tables.

Append a rule which forwards all packets from **eth0** to **tun0**.

```shell
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i end0 -o tun0 -j ACCEPT
```

Allow traffic for established and related connections from **eth0** to **tun0**.

```shell
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i tun0 -o end0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
```

Enable **NAT (Network Address Translation)** for outgoing packets on **tun0**, so they appear to come from the VPNâ€™s IP address. This is essential for devices on the local network (our TV) to route traffic through the VPN and receive responses correctly.

```shell
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o tun0 -j MASQUERADE
```

If we want these rules to work after a reboot, then we need to make these persistent.

```shell
sudo iptables-save
```

Then we can check the current state of iptables.

```shell
sudo iptables -L -v -n --line-numbers
```

The output will be summat like this.

```shell
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 11644 packets, 11M bytes)
num   pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 1797 packets, 125K bytes)
num   pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         
1     2732  421K ACCEPT     0    --  end0   tun0    0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           
2     7424 9290K ACCEPT     0    --  tun0   end0    0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            state RELATED,ESTABLISHED

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 7720 packets, 1291K bytes)
num   pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         
```

Turn on your TV and check.
